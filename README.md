# Source-Model-Selection
A method of selecting the source model for transfer learning without using the source data

The Transfer Learning experiments that calculated the ground truth performance of selecting various source models were run by Fawaz et. al
see his article at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8621990
We use some of their code for processing the UCR archive data which is available at: https://github.com/hfawaz/bigdata18

The notebooks were developed and run in Google Colab.
