# Source-Model-Selection
A method of selecting the source model for transfer learning without using the source data. This code accompanies the paper ["Source Model Selection for Deep Learning in the Time Series Domain"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949507).

The Transfer Learning experiments that calculated the ground truth performance of selecting various source models were run by [Fawaz et. al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8621990)
We use some of their code for processing the UCR archive data which is available at: https://github.com/hfawaz/bigdata18

The notebooks were developed and run in Google Colab.
